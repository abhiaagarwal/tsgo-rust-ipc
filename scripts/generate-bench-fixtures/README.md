Since I use tsgo as a submodule, I can't actually commit code to it and Microsoft marked all their packages as internal. Thus, this is the script that you should place in `tsgo/cmd` and run from the root of the repo to generate the fixture data.

Also, this code was written by Cursor with Sonnet 4 as I do not know go, it's probably not that good.
